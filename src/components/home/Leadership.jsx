                      and different community building events. I have organized and delivered different technolgy training on
                      niche skills. Apart from work I have done lot of cultural events related to socail causes like food wastage
                      awareness.
                      Currently, I in <b>Cognizant</b> I am leading a community where I help them set there goals and guide tham on
                      how to accomplish them. Organizing different communiyt event which include tech conference and community get
                      together to share the knowledge across populace.
